Put WebTide tiled GeoJSON'ized datasets here.

The idea is to have geo-referenced and pre-tiled tidal 
constituents datasets as points features.

i.e. The regular tiles can be considered as GeoJSON 
polygons with points features holding WebTide tidal
constituents.

One Ln tile -> one GeoJSON file holding data from 
a WebTIde specific dataset with its tidal 
constituents grid points features enclosed by
the tile bounding box.

Need to have L5 for STLE400, L6 for Halifax harbour
L3 for NW Atl and Arctic datasets but need to do
experiments for West Coast data for the optimal
tiles level to use in that case.
